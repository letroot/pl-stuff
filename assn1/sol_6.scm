;;Define and test a procedure zip that takes two lists and forms a new list, each element of which is a pair 
;;formed by combining the corresponding elements of the two input lists. If the two lists are of uneven length, 
;;then drop the tail of the longer one.

;;I already defined join-list in the solution to problem 1 :D
(define join-list
  (lambda (list-1 list-2)
    (cond ((null? list-1) list-2)
          (else (cons (car list-1) (join-list (cdr list-1) list-2))))))

(define zip
  (lambda (list-1 list-2)
    (define zipper
      (lambda (list-1 list-2 new)
        (if (or (null? list-1) (null? list-2))
            new
            (zipper (cdr list-1) (cdr list-2) (join-list new (list (cons (car list-1) (car list-2))))))))
    (zipper list-1 list-2 '())))

;;Tests
(zip '(1 2 3) '(2 3 4))
;;((1 . 2) (2 . 3) (3 . 4))

(zip '(1 2 3) '(a b c 2 3 4))
;;((1 . a) (2 . b) (3 . c))
